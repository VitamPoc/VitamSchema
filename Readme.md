The Vitam project is hold by several french entities, among them the French National Archives, the French Diplomatic Archives and the French Defense Archives.

Those applications are by no mean a definitive product but a prototype to try and test different options in the preliminary steps of the Vitam Project.


This Project is about proposing a prototype schema for SIP.
In Schema is the schema based on MEDONA (AFNOR NF Z44-022) and SEDA 1.0, as a basis for future SEDA 2.0.
In Schema/techdesc is a partial schema for technical metadata (not validated).
In Schema/Sae is a partial schema for technical metadata in the SAE, from SIP.
In sources is various documentations, schema and example from previous projects or norms or institutions.
